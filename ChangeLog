	dialog: fix processes serialization when fetching sharing tag state
	High contention on a RW lock aquired for switchable reading has the same
	downsides as direclty aquring it for writing. This commit improves this

	ops (start/stop read/write).

2019-02-22  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [0de94a899] :

	rr: Fix a buffer mgm bug during strict routing callbacks
	While doing strict routing (e.g. the R-URI host is a local domain) and
	executing the module callbacks, the rr module would provide some bogus
	memory pointer as the result of the rr_api.get_route_param() function.

	Although opensips would not crash due to the dangling pointer residing
	in pkg memory, some callbacks would misbehave (e.g. uac_auth() would
	fail to adjust the outbound ACK CSeq, since it cannot locate the ";aci"
	Route header field parameter within the dangling pkg area).

	Related to #1613
	(cherry picked from commit ec89b78667430da51e4146bc7f2514f68e9d21a9)

	Merge pull request #1614 from wdoekes/wjd-correct-presence-list-mi-flush-2.4
	Correct presence list MI flush in OpenSIPS 2.4


2019-02-12  Walter Doekes  <walter+github at wjd dot nu>
	* [fd75d765e] :

	mi_datagram: Correct leftover bytes count
	Before this fix, a flush_mi_tree without new data would decrement the
	bytes-left for no reason, and after a bunch of these, we'd run out of space.

	Errors like these would flood the logs:

	    failed to write -line too long!
	    failed to write - EOC does not fit in!

	Additionally, mi_datagram_write_node would decrease the length by more than
	necessary, causing less than half the full size to fit in the response.

	(dtgram->len is "bytes left", not "total length")


2019-02-12  Walter Doekes  <walter+github at wjd dot nu>
	* [fd3a6e4a7] :

	presence: MI flush subs_phtable_list only if there is data
	Also flush pres_phtable_list after more than 50 entries.

	Corrects problem with (soon to be removed) mi-datagram where flushing
	after 0 bytes creates a negative response.


2019-02-11  Răzvan Crainea  <razvan at opensips dot org>
	* [d57ce2d41] :

2019-02-02  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [033db9fd0] :

	Fixed uninit len for th_contact_encode_passwd param.
	As the used len was all the time 10 (the len of the default passwd), if you have set a shorter one, the actual used passwd has some trailing memory garbage (up to 10 char len). This grabage could be (99.999%) constant during runtime, but 100% different after a restart. Shorly, the decoding on ongoing contact would have failed after a restart.

	This bug could be triggered in failover scenarios, where the accounting

	    * create_dialog();
	    * $acc_extra(foo) = "bar"; # create a dialog-stored acc context
	    * t_relay(); exit; # msg is relayed, but ctx is unused =>
		the code frees it and leaves a NULL dialog value marker.

	      NULL context stored inside dialog, dereference it and crash.

	dialog: fix behavior of backup node when replicating dialogs
	The node that has a backup state for the sharing tag of a dialog
	was incorrectly:
	* skipping the replication of all dialog events
	* bypassing all registered DLGCB_TERMINATED and DLGCB_EXPIRED callbacks

	This behavior was causing issues when replies and sequential requests did
	arrive on the backup node. Eg. unable to match and fix the BYE for an
	existing topology hiding dialog.

	After this fix, only the acc and cgrates modules will skip all actions in the
	above mentioned callbacks if the sharing tag is backup.

	After refactoring the code to enable clustering in 2.4, some of the DB queries for updating / deleting the presentity records were missing the etag condition. As a result you may have experienced records leaking in DB or strange errors about unique key violation.
	Many thanks for helping with the troubleshooting to Dan Pascu @ AG Projects and to Ognjen Šešlija.

	rest_client: Fix some POST/PUT corner-cases
	This patch addresses two rare bugs such that they may now only occur
	with old curl versions (pre 7.17.1, that's pre 2007).

	When calling rest_post() or rest_put(), assuming we're fetching the
	request body buffer into "req_body" via fixup_get_svalue():

	    1. since req_body->s is not dup'ed and may point to a PV buf,
		the next SIP message may impact the currently "just launched"
		async transfer by overriding the value stored in the PV buffer
		before libcurl fully reads it

	    2. req_body->s is provided by a PV which does not NULL-terminate
		strings (e.g. $du), thus curl's strlen() may overflow or crash

	This commit fixes the following bugs introduced in commit 00cddf7:
	1. when it was called, it was removing all the linkers of a dialog
	2. it was not removing the actual linker it was called for, causing
	constant increase in size for that specific profile (and leak)
	3. when temporary copying the profiles list, the values were not copied,
	thus they might have dissapeared when the actual cleanup was done.

	Many thanks to Jonathan Hulme for reporting the issue and providing
	testing framework for detecting the bug and testing the fix!

	systemd: Properly shut down OpenSIPS 2.4+ instances
	OpenSIPS 2.4 is meant to be shut down gracefully, in order to minimize
	any form of data corruption caused by partial processing of SIP
	messages.  Running "killall opensips" has a good chance of deadlocking
	OpenSIPS for the next 45 seconds, especially if it's doing a lot of
	logging.  This is often the case with the current systemd logic.

	This patch updates the opensips systemd service files so they only
	deliver SIGTERM to the attendant process.

2018-07-23  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [82b14ed05] :

	core: Greatly reduce chance of truncated corefiles
	Before commit 8073d4de8ed, the SIGTERM signal delivered by the attendant
	process to a process who had already crashed and would be dumping its
	memory inside the SIGSEGV handler would stay queued and not disrupt the
	generation of the corefile.  At worst, corefile generation would take
	above "shutdown_time" seconds (60), and OpenSIPS would SIGKILL its
	entire process group and definitively terminate.

	Now, OpenSIPS behavior has changed to:
	    * attendant broadcasts a graceful IPC shutdown job
	    * attendant gives _everyone_ a grand total of 5 seconds to finish
	    * if not ready -> SIGKILL the entire instance

	This behavior is too restrictive for the average spinning disk
	performance.  Coupled with the fact that SHM pools of 2+ GB are common
	nowadays AND the fact that, occasionally, corefiles come in multiples, 5
	seconds is not a lot of time.

	This patch fixes the behavior to:
	    * attendant broadcasts a graceful IPC shutdown job
	    * attendant gives non-crashed processes 5 seconds to obey
	    * if not ready -> SIGKILL any processes which are still running
	    * perform cleanup(60 sec) (leave the core-dumping processes alone)
	    * exit or abort cleanup (leave the core-dumping processes alone)

	Thanks to Bogdan for significantly directing the design of this patch

2018-07-23  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [0d5864c24] :

	core: Clean up outdated SIGKILL-based shutdown code
	When not in "debug" mode (i.e. when opensips successfully daemonizes),
	the kill_all_children(SIGKILL) function will actually send SIGKILL
	to the entire process group ID, including its owner.  In this case, all
	code that follows after it is _dead_ code.

	This includes the final cleanup() sequence, which would be desirable to
	run even during an emergency shutdown (e.g. OpenSIPS deadlocked,
	SIGKILL'ed all its children, yet managed to do a last-second DB dump of
	all dialogs and contacts).

	This patch fixes the following:

	    * rewrite kill_all_children() to actually do what it says: "only
	      kill the children".  No need to send kill() to the pgid.

	    * remove the alarm()+wait() logic around kill_all_children(SIGKILL).
	      Even if opensips is not daemonized (so the SIGKILL only gets sent
	      to each enumerated process), if, by absurd, we failed to count all
	      processes within the for() loop of the first call, installing a
	      signal handler for yet another kill_all_children(SIGKILL) call is
	      pretty much useless -- we will still stay stuck in while(wait()).

	    * remove the "now unused" sig_alarm_kill() function

	    * improve function docs

	dialog: Properly store all downstream forked legs
	Commit a03ed4e1a36 over-simplified the downstream leg identification,
	assuming that there is a 1:1 correspondence between outgoing branches
	and unique replies to them.  This is not the case: as a proxy, we may
	receive multiple responses (read: "To" tags) for each individual branch
	we fork out.  This misconception would also cause SHM to leak.

	We fix the above limitation by cloning a new dialog leg each time we
	detect downstream forking of our outgoing branches.

2018-05-24  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [045eea09b] :

	path: Fix "use_path_received" in double-Path scenarios
	Due to the fact that run_rr_callbacks() returns the 2nd Route (Path)
	header field value when previously having done protocol switching (thus
	having inserted two Path headers), the "use_path_received" feature of
	the path module would not work -- it wouldn't set the $du at all.

	The reason for this is that add_path_received() appends its ";received="
	to inside Path #1 (the outbound path of the registration / the inbound
	path of future requests) when doing double-Path recording.

	This patch simply moves the ";received=" append operation performed by
	add_path_received() into Path #2 (inbound path of registration /
	outbound path of future requests), and adapts other code that needs it
	(e.g. save("location", "p1v")) to properly be able to fetch it.

	Reported by @futsystems

	Fixes #1358

2018-05-24  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [0e60448cb] :

	path: Add escaping logic for add_path_received()
	Simply dumping a SIP URI as a ";received=" Path header field parameter
	value is problematic and leads to two kinds of issues:

	a. invalid SIP URIs, where the ";transport=" is specified twice:

	Path: <sip:127.0.0.1:5061;transport=tcp;lr; ...
	       ... received=sip:127.0.0.1:51959;transport=tcp>

	b. in double Path scenarios (e.g. when switching protocols from, say,
	TCP -> UDP), since the ";received=" is inserted as the
	inbound Path header field value, this can lead to a strange
	"protocol conversion" effect:

	Path: <sip:127.0.0.1:5061;r2=on;lr ...
	       ... ;received=sip:127.0.0.1:42917;transport=tcp>
	Path: <sip:127.0.0.1:5061;transport=tcp;r2=on;lr>

	^ notice how the inbound Path intended to advertise an UDP URI, but the
	add_path_received() managed to "convert" it into a TCP URI because of
	its inability to escape its token. nathelper is an easy first victim of
	this conversion, as it will attempt to send pings using the incorrect
	transport after reading the topmost Path (Route) header.

	This patch adds escaping/unescaping logic for the ";received=" feature
	of add_path_received() along with any code that makes use of this
	feature. Example resulting URI for the above example:

	Path: <sip:127.0.0.1:5061;r2=on;lr ...
	       ... ;received=sip:127.0.0.1:42917%3dtransport%3btcp>

	dialog: Always match dialogs using dlg_match_mode
	This patch changes the default behavior of match_dialog() and
	topology_hiding_match(), where they would both forcibly use DID_FALLBACK
	matching, regardless of the value of the "dlg_match_mode" modparam.

	Starting with 2.4, we change this behavior such that they default
	to simply playing along with "dlg_match_mode", which is a lot
	more intuitive from a script writing perspective.

	If need be, a specific dialog matching behavior may be enforced for
	certain types of traffic using the newly added optional parameters of
	match_dialog() and topology_hiding_match().

	In looping scenarios, performing SIP-wise dialog matching may be out of

	* [fba65033e] :

	dialog: Fix Re-INVITE pinging issues with parallel forking
	The Re-INVITE pinging code would always leak both SDP and contact buffers
	when parallel forking. Moreover, depending on which branch answered
	the call, in some cases OpenSIPS would only Re-INVITE ping one of the
	parties involved, even if both "Rr" create_dialog() flags are set.

	This patch fixes the above issues by storing the SDPs of each forked
	branch into the "callee" leg array. Each call leg gets created before
	the INVITE branch is sent out, rather than only getting created upon
	matching a 200 OK reply. When matching a reply, the corresponding leg
	becomes 1 + the Via branch idx, which added by tm. (0, 1, 2, ...)

	Remaining issue:
	Proper handling for the multi-200 OK scenario, as we currently still
	overwrite the callee SDP at each 200 OK.

	This is useful when an OpenSIPS ping originator node is front-ended

	the front-end will still respond to the pings (e.g. 408 Request Timeout),

	* [f7bed45a4] :

	Added support for sharding/partitioning cluster.
	A sharding clustering is a presence cluster where each node keeps its own set of watchers and presentities of an interest. Any new Published presentity is replicated to all the cluster nodes, but stored only by nodes interested in it (if there are watchers for that presentity). For initial subscriptions, there is quering mechnism inside the cluster - to try to fetch the presentity data from any other node.

	Added support for extra headers per body part.
	When adding a body part (directly via sipmsgops module or indirectly via sip_i module), you can specify an optional list of SIP headers (fully formated, including the header terminator) to be pushed into the part next to the Content-Type header.
	The specific changes:
	* in sipmsgops module, the add_body_part() takes a third optional parameter for extra headers to be pushed into the part;
	* in sip_i module, the add_isup_part() funtion takes a second optional parameter for defining a custom set of extra headers;
	* in sip_i_module, a new module parameter "default_part_headers" can be used to define the default set of headers to be automatically pushed into the ISUP parts.

2018-03-14  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [e0fe570fe] :

	usrloc/nathelper: Compute and report ping latencies
	This patch adds a new nathelper branch flag, "sipping_latency_flag", to
	enable ping latency computation. Also, a new usrloc event is now available,
	E_UL_LATENCY_UPDATE. All contact-related usrloc events now include a new
	parameter, "latency", which holds the latency of the last successful
	ping if any, or 0 otherwise. If available, the ping latency can also be
	accessed via MI, using the "Ping-Latency" key of the contact data.

	Credits for the idea and an initial version of this patch go to
	Shlomi Gutman <shlomi@voicenter.com>.

2018-03-10  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [79418dce9] :

	build system: Add special handling for gcc 7.2
	It appears that gcc's "-dumpversion" behaves differently in 7.2
	than in previous versions, due to "-dumpfullversion" being introduced.

	$ gcc -dumpversion
	7
	$ gcc -dumpfullversion
	7.2.0

	This breaks compilation on systems such as Xubuntu 17.10 with:

	Makefile.defs:930: You are using an old and unsupported gcc version
	(7), compile at your own risk!

	This backwards-incompatible change seems to have been reverted in 7.3+,
	though, where the full version is once again being dumped:

	$ gcc -dumpversion
	7.3.0
	$ gcc -dumpfullversion
	7.3.0

2018-03-02  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [f14801795] :

	Added new set of load statistics for extra procs.
	The "load" set of stats (rt, 1m, 10m) covers now only the OpenSIPS core processes (it does not count the load for the extra processes forked by the modules).
	The new "load-all" set will count the load for *all* OpenSIPS procs, core or module.


2018-03-02  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [f06624568] :

	Added more flags when forking internal processes.
	Two new flags were added :
	* NO_LOAD - the process should not be counted when calculated the load
	* IS_EXTRA - this is an EXTRA process requests by a module (it is not an OpenSIPS core process)

	Revert "travis: compile mongodb module"
	This reverts commit 9d30f94dc45a4e99f42d1fd22e8a96273e6d3c29.

	Since "libmongo-client" is a completely different codebase
	(https://github.com/algernon/libmongo-client) from the official
	"mongo-c-driver" project and "libmongoc" package
	(https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver), we have to disable

	cachedb: Simplify the column-oriented API
	Since some NoSQL backends support upsert-enabled "set" and "unset" operations
	on multiple key/value pairs using a single query, we can merge the "set_cols()"
	and "unset_cols()" functions into a single one: "update()". Current
	backends known to support this are MongoDB and Cassandra.

	Any backends which do not support the above will have to implement the update()
	endpoint using two queries instead of one.

	F_MALLOC: Recover from double pointer free
	This patch makes F_MALLOC more robust in production by avoiding memory
	corruption in case of double free operations. Previously, the hash state
	would immediately get corrupted on such operations, and it would only be
	a matter of time before the allocator would crash in some random place
	with a useless backtrace resembling:

	\#0  0x0000000000507209 in fm_remove_free (qm=0x7f7d578d2010, size=56) at
	mem/f_malloc.c:200

	similar to QM_MALLOC.

2018-02-14  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [2d3c0733d] :

	Add a basic unit testing framework
	Currently, this framework only supports writing unit tests for core
	code, but there are plans to expand it such that module tests can be
	easily written as well.

	The chosen C unit testing framework is libtap
	(https://github.com/zorgnax/libtap) - very lightweight and full of goodies.

	In order to write a core unit test, you should write the test file
	under a "test/" dir which resides right next to the tested file. The
	build system is smart enough to link any such test files placed in
	random test dirs all across the core codebase. Next, you enrol your
	test file to be init'ed and run in test/unit_tests.c, and you're done.

	To run the entire unit testing suite, just do "make test". You will
	have to type this command twice if you haven't enabled "-DUNIT_TESTS"
	under Makefile.conf beforehand.

2018-01-29  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [091149b07] :

	Added new load support based on active/idle time.
	The way the internal load is calculated and reported is radically changed. Instead of providing per-interface load and only for SIP related processing, the new "load" support calculates per process the amount of time spent in any processing (outside the I/O reactor) versus total time. The time granularity is 1us. This new system covers any kind of handling (SIP, timer, async, etc) inside a process.
	The TCP main and timer handler will also provide load information. In the future, the extra processes (per module) may easily record their load information.
	Each process (and globally) reports 3 load statistics:
	* realtime load, computed over the last 1s
	* last 1 minute load
	* last 10 minutes load

	Example via "opensipsctl fifo get_statistics load:" :
	load:load:: 24
	load:load1m:: 19
	load:load10m:: 1
	load:load-proc-1:: 0
	load:load1m-proc-1:: 0
	load:load10m-proc-1:: 0
	load:load-proc-2:: 0
	load:load1m-proc-2:: 0
	load:load10m-proc-2:: 0
	load:load-proc-3:: 0
	load:load1m-proc-3:: 0
	load:load10m-proc-3:: 0
	load:load-proc-4:: 67

	load:load10m-proc-4:: 2

	usrloc contact structures. Currently, only the mid_registrar module is making
	use of this feature.

	Moreover, the implementation also includes persistency for the
	record-level K/V storage. This is achieved with a special key, "_urec_kvs",
	that will only be present in one of the contacts' K/V store.

	Modules now register "capabilities" to clusterer. Instead of a single callback,
	a module now registers callbacks for each capability. Also, nodes discover the

	protos/tcp: respect async operations order
	In case there is a write request, before actually writing the data on
	the network, check if there are any async chunks left, and make sure
	they are sent before any other write happens. This is necessary to make
	sure the order of the packets is respected, otherwise we might end up
	with fragments of other packets in the stream.

	Thanks go to Vlad Patrascu for reporting and testing this.

2018-01-09  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [19756d46c] :

	Added support for graceful shutdown.
	Graceful shutdown is based on IPC commands sent to worker processes, rather than terminating them by SIGTERM. This will allow the workers to complete on ongoing task and to terminate in a consistent state (as locking or data consistency).
	TO DO:
	 * move PKG memory dumping and memory stats to IPC/RPC (versus signals)
	Nice to have:
	 * child_destroy() functions to allow modules to do per-child/process cleanup (like closing DB conns, flushing, etc)

	mid_registrar: Fix a PKG memory leak
	Although the TMCB_RESPONSE_IN callback provides a reference to the initial
	request during reply processing, this sip_msg must not be parsed (i.e. passed
	to parse_headers()), otherwise we leak PKG memory, since parsing is
	PKG-based, while the request buffer is copied in SHM.

	The current workaround for mid_registrar is to immediately duplicate all
	contact-related data we could possibly need, should the contact successfully
	register on the downstream registrar. This copying takes place during request
	processing. Once the reply arrives, we only make use of this info in order to
	store the contact in usrloc, and barely even use the "req" sip_msg
	provided by tm.

2017-12-20  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [ff83a31e4] :

	freeswitch: Refactor API
	    * add generic FS event subscribe/unsubscribe function stubs
	    * new modparam: "event_heartbeat_interval"
	    * expose "event_heartbeat_interval" in API, use wherever needed
	    * improve naming for stats-based socket API functions
	    * remove the callback-based support for updating stats
	      (this never worked anyway, ds/lb would always pull data)

	lib: Add generic URL parsing support
	Very re-usable (db/db.c, cachedb/cachedb_id.c, modules/freeswitch/fs_api.c,
	MongoDB, etc.). Importing code can easily customize their URLs by
	enforcing/relaxing: scheme part, user part, pass part, ports, database and
	extra hosts.

	This patch also adds a new URL extension: parameters!

	Syntax: scheme://...?foo=bar,foo

	Refer to lib/url.h for the full spec

	* [69ef92cd9] :

2017-12-19  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [908b9f190] :

	Fix hdr parsing to accept multi-value bodies.
	The parser for Diversion, PAI and PPI use now the parse_multi_to() in order to handle multi name-addr/addr-spec hdr bodies.


2017-12-19  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [a7e724a09] :

	Refactor generic parse_to() to accept multi-value headers.
	New function parse_multi_to() added to allow parsing of multi-value (comma separated) name-addr/addr-spec headers (like Diversion, PAI, PPI).
	Changes are backward compatible in regards to original parse_to() function.

	mid_registrar: Fix CSeq handling for De-REGISTERs

	mid_registrar: Fix NAT issues in "contact" insertion mode
	This patch completely reworks the saving/matching logic with regards
	to the SIP contacts generated by the mid-registrar. It is only relevant
	to working modes "0" (mirror) and "1" (contact throttling).

	The former logic (encoding the requests's Contact as a URI parameter
	of the outgoing contact) was somewhat stateless, as it would forward
	requests to the mid-registrar's contacts directly to their actual Contact
	URIs (UA side). When NAT comes into play, this no longer works well.

	Fortunately, the user location already handles this problem. Thus, we
	change the mid-registrar to advertise contact IDs instead of the device's
	contact. As requests arrive for the contact IDs, we are easily able to
	look up their corresponding user location AoR, contact, along with any
	other useful information for NAT traversal.

	* [ad274fad9] :

	usrloc: Add urecord reference counting mechanism
	This mechanism is required by the mid-registrar, which needs to
	"reserve" contact IDs while the main registrar decides upon them.
	This means that a blank urecord structure must be kept alive during
	this process.

	By reference counting the blank urecord structures, we prevent them
	from being cleared by the timer before the outgoing registrations
	get a chance to receive a reply.

	dialog: fix a runtime bug with DLGCB_LOADED callbacks
	Relying on the fact that all modules that register dialog callbacks are initialised
	after the dialog module (thanks to module dependencies), we can run all DLGCB_LOADED
	callbacks at registration time and also keep them in a list for calling them later
	(i.e reloading from database via MI cmd or receiving replicated dialog).

	This fixes a series of bugs where the DLGCB_LOADED callback is not run during, e.g.
	"dlg_db_sync" MI command or received replicated dialogs which do not have their
	callbacks installed or run.

	* [f522b0ef0] :

	mid_registrar: Fix mem corruption on SIP retransmissions
	The TMCB_RESPONSE_IN function gets called once per each retransmission,
	and we want to avoid this in the mid_registrar code. Since the callbacks
	themselves are mutually exclusive, we can get away with zeroizing our own
	parameter after the first run.

	A better way of fixing this would be to extend the tm callback API to
	include SIP retransmission preferences.

	To avoid such probles, the "connect" tracing will be flushed on write (a connect is always trigger by a write need) and the "accept" tracing will be flushed only on read (an accept is always followed by a read).

	Connections which received a read event concurrently with their

	succession of back-forth passing of the connection object between TCP Main
	and a TCP worker process.

	The fix involves adding a TCP connection lifetime update in the TCP worker

	Before this fix, rtpproxy was accepting a single connection from a

	simultaneously.
	Using this fix each rtpproxy provisioned can have on connection to

	This commit also adds some extra debugging.

		This commit fixes 2 bugs:
		1) fixes not reading second part of a single TCP request
	because of bad parsed pointer update;
		2) fixes major bug that was causing packets to be processed
	infinite times by hep callback when one message + some part of a
	second message came in a chunk and in the second chunk it was the
	second part of the second message; the tcp request structure was
	not updated(complete was not set to 0 after first message was
	processed) causing the second message to be processed an infinte amount
	of times into the database;
